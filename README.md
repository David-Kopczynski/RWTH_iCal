## Commands

`yarn dev` for development testing
`yarn build` in order to build the application for distribution

## How to use

After installation the application can be launched without the need of additional software.
In order to update an existing iCal-file, simply select the file when asked to do so and replace the calendar events with new summaries and descriptions. It is possible to ignore any of the events during that process, so that they are ignored when exporting to a new file. Afterwards, any locations that are unknown can be input by typing in the actual address and geo location. At last, a new export prompt is opened and the file can be saved. Any inputs are stored and will be remembered the next time they are used. Should some information be input faulty, the `config.json` file can be found at `%appdata%/rwth_ical` and deleted.
